# Snek :snake:

**Snek** is a statically typed, interpreted programming language with Python/Rust inspired syntax, implemented entirely in **C**.

<!-- > A tiny language with a clean, readable surface â€” and a strict, typed core underneath. -->

## Purpose

Snek is a learning project aimed at exploring:

- Language design
- Writing interpreters in C
- Implementing a type system
- Building syntax and semantics from scratch

## Features

- **Static typing** for variables and functions
- **Pythonic syntax**: indentation, no semicolons
- **Rust keywords**: `let`/ `const`/`fn`
- **Expression-based** evaluation
- **Hand-written parser and interpreter in C**
- Designed for simplicity, not full general-purpose use

## Example Snek Code

```snek
fn main() -> int:
    let x: int = 10
    let y: int = x + 2

    x +=1
    return y
```
